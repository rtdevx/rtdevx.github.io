This methodology leads to higher productivity.\nZettelkasten is not only a note taking system. It is a tool that is used for thinking since it brings a structure to note taking and \u0026ldquo;connecting the dots\u0026rdquo;.\nThis method is often called a \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo;. And it is so for a reason\u0026hellip;\nThe history of the Zettelkasten method #The Zettelkasten method was created in the 20th century by social scientist Niklas Luhman. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.\nWriting is understanding! #Each note contains the thought or idea and should be written in own words. This helps mapping the ideas in human brain. Process similar to translation takes place which helps with understanding the topic.\nStructuring, simplifying and linking ideas helping storing them outside of the brain and helping with solving complex problems.\nA good system removes the need for remembering everything.\nI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.\nNiklas Luhmann\nHighly productive people deflect resistance like judo champions. Having a flexible workflow allows doing this. This is known as \u0026ldquo;effortless productivity\u0026rdquo;.\nContent Consumption # Intentionality for content consumption 80% of content consumed scheduled and aligned with goals articles reading, YouTube videos watching are all scheduled beforehand with a clear purpose each act of content consumption should align with one of the goals set 20% of content consumption used for relaxing Intentionality # Consume the content with an intention of writing increased focus allows adapting more observant and analytical perspective Being intentional about content consumption will limit the content consumption Obsidian - markdown-based, multi-platform note taking app #Obsidian is a note-taking app that lets you link notes together.

One cannot exist without the other\nWilliam Zinnser\nFleeting notes #Notes being taken during content consumption are called Fleeting Notes. These are being used only as a reminder to take action later and put notes in the right order.\nEphemeral - temporary, should be processed on the same or next day Brief - few words or ideas Quick capture This ability is a cornerstone of effective learning and productivity.\nPermanent notes # Articulated\nWritten in own words\nSolidified\nOne idea per card\nDo not copy\nBrief and concise\nWrite to publish\nQuotes allowed - they add context and can add value\nConsistency in transferring Fleeting notes to Permanent notes should be frequent / daily.\nLinking notes # Linking permanent notes is a powerful way of building knowledge Allows to see connection between notes Makes easier to recall and apply knowledge Don\u0026rsquo;t collect information. Gather knowledge instead. Linking leads to surprises\u0026hellip;\nTags vs Folders #Folders are for separating, tags are for uniting\nAvoid moving files around Navigation benefits Satisfaction of collecting in folders Note taking system should free up time Sources #Zettelkasten # Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method How to Use the Zettelkasten Method for Notetaking Obsidian # Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking ","date":"19 August 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/productivity/250819-zettelkasten/","section":"Posts","summary":"Increase your productivity with zettelkasten, highly effective note taking method\u0026hellip;","title":"Zettelkasten note taking method"},{"content":"Experienced IT professional accomplished in supporting and delivering secure, resilient, and PCI-compliant infrastructure solutions across international payment ecosystems.
