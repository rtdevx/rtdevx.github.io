Communication process entails both directions (encapsulation and decapsulation).\nLayers 5,6 and 7 can be grouped together. They are all responsible to produce the data (Protocol Data Unit - PDU) for the Transport layer.\n7. Application Layer #\rApplications produce the data for the Transport layer and often provide a user interface to interact with.\nExample protocols used in the Application layer: HTTP(S), SMTP, FTP,DNS, SSH\u0026hellip;\nThe application layer is concerned with the specific type of application.\n6. Presentation Layer #\rThe presentation layer is primarily responsible for syntax of the data for the applications to send and consume (e.g. HTML, CSV, JSON).\nEncryption / Decryption Compression 5. Session Layer #\rSession Layer is responsible for establishing, managing, terminating sessions between two devices.\nNetwork File System (NFS) or Server Message Block (SMB) are commonly used protocols at the session layer.\nOSI and TCP IP Models - Best Explanation\n4. Transport Layer #\rThe primary role of the Transport Layer is to ensure that data packets arrive in the right order.\nTCP - data must be intact (e.g. file sharing) acknowledgment (ACK) of the successful data transmission and re-transmission of the data in error slower than UDP but more reliable UDP - retaining packets is less critical (e.g. video streaming) faster than TCP but less reliable (no ACK) The data in the transport layer is referred to as segments. In this layer source and destination port is added in the header. Segmentation is essential for multiplexing.\n3. Network Layer #\rThe Network Layer is responsible for the transmission of data (in this layer referred to as packets) from one host to another that is located in different networks.\nNetwork Layer also takes care of routing - finding the shortest path to transmit the packet, from a number of routes available.\nNetwork Layer is utilizing IP protocol in order to route. Network devices (routers and switches) are appending the source and destination IP address to the packet\u0026rsquo;s header.\n2. Data Link Layer #\rThe Data Link Layer refers to technologies used to connect two machines across a network.\nData in this layer is referred to as frame.\nEthernet is an example of a standard at this layer. Switches and Bridges are common Data Link Layer devices. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:\nLogical Link Control (LLC) Media Access Control (MAC) 1. Physical Layer #\rThe Physical Layer refers to the physical communication medium and technologies to transmit data across that medium.\nThe physical layer contains information in the form of bits. Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.\nWhen receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together. Common physical layer devices are Hub, Repeater, Modem, and Cables.\nMore: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\r\u0026raquo; Sources \u0026laquo; #\rWhat is OSI Model:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\rhttps://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/\r\u0026raquo; Disclaimer \u0026laquo; #\rDisclaimer: Content for educational purposes only, no rights reserved.\r","date":"1 September 2025","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/networking/osi-model/","section":"Posts","summary":"What is OSI Model? - Layers of OSI Model\u0026hellip;","title":"OSI Model"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/categories/aws/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"AWS"},{"content":"The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner\rvalidates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology.

Security #\rSecurity includes an ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. #\rDesign Principles:\nImplement a strong identity foundation - centralize privilege management and reduce (or eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials - Principle of least privilege - IAM\rEnable traceability - integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action - Cloud Monitoring\rApply security at all layers - edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, (every) EC2 instance, operating system, application Automate security best practices Protect data in transit and at rest - encryption\r, tokenization\rand access control\rKeep people away from data - reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data Prepare for security events - run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed of detection, investigation and recovery 3. Reliability #\rReliability is an ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues. #\rDesign Principles:\nTest recovery procedures - use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before Automatically recover from failure - anticipate and remediate failures before they occur Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability - distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don\u0026rsquo;t share a common point of failure Stop guessing capacity - maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning Manage change in automation - use automation to make changes to infrastructure 4. Performance Efficiency #\rPerformance Efficiency includes ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. #\rDesign Principles:\nDemocratize advanced technologies - advance technologies become services and hence you can focus more on product development Go Global in minutes - easy deployment in multiple regions Use serverless architecture - avoid the burden of managing servers Experiment more often - easy to carry out comparative testing Mechanical sympathy - be aware of all AWS services 5. Cost Optimization #\rCost Optimization includes ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. #\rDesign Principles:\nAdopt a consumption mode - pay only for what you use Measure overall efficiency - use CloudWatch\rStop spending money on data center operations - AWS does the infrastructure part and enables customer to focus on organization projects Analyze and attribute expenditure - accurate identification of system usage and costs helps to measure Return on Investment (ROI) - make sure to use tags! Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership - as managed services operate at cloud scale then can offer a lower cost per transaction or service 6. Sustainability #\rSustainability focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of running cloud workloads. #\rDesign Principles:\nUnderstand your impact - establish performance indicators, evaluate improvements Establish sustainability goals - set long-term goals for each workload, model Return on Investment (ROI) Maximize utilization = right size each workload to maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings - and design for flexibility to adopt new technologies over time Use managed services - shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure AWS Well-Architected Tool #\rFree tool to review your architecture against the 6 pillars of Well-Architected Framework and adopt architectural best practices.\nAWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool #\rTool to track, measure, review and forecast the carbon emissions generated from your AWS usage.\nAWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) #\rHelps you build and then execute a comprehensive plan for your digital transformation through innovative use of AWS.\nCreated by AWS Professionals by taking advantage of AWS Best Practices and lessons learned from 1000s of customers.\nAWS CAF groups it\u0026rsquo;s capabilities in six perspectives: #\rBusiness\nBusiness perspective helps to ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes People\nServes a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning and where change becomes BAU Governance\nHelps orchestrating cloud initiatives while maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation related risks Platform\nHelps building an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform and modernize existing workloads Security\nHelps achieving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and cloud workflows Operations\nHelps ensuring that your cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)\nAWS CAF - Transformation Domains #\rTechnology - using the cloud to migrate and modernize legacy infrastructure, applications, data and analytics platforms Process - digitizing, automating and optimizing your business operations Organization - reimagining your operating model AWS CAF - Transformation Phases #\rEnvision - demonstrate how the Cloud will accelerate business outcomes Align - identify capability gaps across the 6 AWS CAF Perspectives which results in an Action Plan Launch - build and deliver pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate incremental business value Scale - expand pilot initiatives to the desired scale while realizing the desired business benefits More: AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)\rAWS Right Sizing #\rEC2\rhas many instance types\r.

This methodology leads to higher productivity.\nZettelkasten is not only a note taking system.

And it is so for a reason\u0026hellip;\nThe history of the Zettelkasten method #\rThe Zettelkasten method was created in the 20th century by social scientist Niklas Luhman. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.\nWriting is understanding! #\rEach note contains the thought or idea and should be written in own words. This helps mapping the ideas in human brain. Process similar to translation takes place which helps with understanding the topic.\nStructuring, simplifying and linking ideas helping storing them outside of the brain and helping with solving complex problems.\nA good system removes the need for remembering everything.\nI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.\nNiklas Luhmann\nHighly productive people deflect resistance like judo champions. Having a flexible workflow allows doing this.
