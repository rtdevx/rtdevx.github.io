And it is so for a reason\u0026hellip;\nThe history of the Zettelkasten method #The Zettelkasten method was created in the 20th century by social scientist Niklas Luhman. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.\nWriting is understanding! #Each note contains the thought or idea and should be written in own words. This helps mapping the ideas in human brain. Process similar to translation takes place which helps with understanding the topic.\nStructuring, simplifying and linking ideas helping storing them outside of the brain and helping with solving complex problems.\nA good system removes the need for remembering everything.\nI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.\nNiklas Luhmann\nHighly productive people deflect resistance like judo champions. Having a flexible workflow allows doing this.
