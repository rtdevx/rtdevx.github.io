The `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner` validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology.  This is a good starting point on the AWS Certification journey for individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career or for line-of-business employees looking for foundational cloud literacy.

A lot of the content in this series is coming from **Stephane Maarek's** [Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 2025](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) course on Udemy.

I highly encourage you to take the [Stephane's courses](https://www.udemy.com/user/stephane-maarek/) as they really help understanding the subject.
