## Setting up a budget

<font color=#EB4925>Billing and Cost Management is only available for the root user (or user with the right privileges).</font>
### 1. Enabling Billing and Cost Management for IAM user

- Log in as root to AWS Console
- Click on your user in the top right corner, select an account
- Scroll down to "_IAM user and role access to Billing information_"
- Activate [IAM]({{< ref "2-iam" >}}) access

This will allow access to billing information for IAM users that are in _Administrators_ group.
