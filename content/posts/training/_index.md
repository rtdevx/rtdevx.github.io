I treat training as an ongoing part of my professional journey - not just to keep up, but to dig deeper. Whether it's automation, infrastructure, or security, each course I take helps me build systems that are resilient, clear, and future-ready. 

This part of my blog highlights the trainings I've completed along the way - chosen with intention, driven by curiosity, and always aimed at doing the work better.
