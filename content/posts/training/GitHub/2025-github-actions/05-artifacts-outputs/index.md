**Job artifacts** in **GitHub Actions** are files generated during a workflow run that can be stored and shared between jobs. They are <font color=#EBAC25>useful for persisting data like test results or build outputs, allowing you to access them after the workflow has completed</font>.

## Job Artifacts

In simple terms, **Job Artifacts** are the **outputs generated by Jobs**. Those could be App binaries, compiled website files but also log files and any other Outputs. 

Those Outputs can be used in Other jobs OR can be downloaded.

### Uploading Job Artifacts

Upload [Actions Artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) from your Workflow Runs.

📄 _File:_ cicd-gh-actions-course/.github/workflows/04-01-artifacts-outputs.yml
```YAML
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Get code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: 04-react-exercise
      - name: Build website
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: 04-react-exercise
      
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v5
        with:
          name: dist-files
          path: 04-react-exercise/dist
```

Official Marketplace GitHub Action for **uploading** the artifacts: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-a-build-artifact
### Downloading Job Artifacts

Download [Actions Artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) from your Workflow Runs (uploaded earlier by the job described in [Uploading Job Artifacts]({{< ref "#uploading-job-artifacts" >}})).

Every job gets its own [runner]({{< ref "03-fundamentals/#job-runners" >}}) - it’s own Virtual Machine that’s totally isolated from other machines and jobs. For that reason Artifact must be first uploaded and then downloaded by another job.

📄 _File:_ cicd-gh-actions-course/.github/workflows/04-01-artifacts-outputs.yml
```YAML
  deploy:
    needs: build # Needs build jobe to complete first for the Artifact to be ready
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
        with:
          name: dist-files
```

Official Marketplace GitHub Action for **downloading** the artifacts: https://github.com/actions/download-artifact

## Job Outputs

In addition to **Artifacts**, we also have the **Job Outputs**.
### Difference between Artifacts and Job Outputs

|                 |                                   |                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Artifacts**   | Output **files** and **folders**. | Typically used for sharing log files, app binaries, etc.                                                                                |
| **Job Outputs** | Output **simple values**.         | Typically used for re-using a value in a different jobs.<br><br><ins><i>Example:</i></ins> Name of a file generated in a previous step. |
### Defining Job Outputs

📄 _File:_ cicd-gh-actions-course/.github/workflows/04-01-artifacts-outputs.yml

{{< highlight html "linenos=table,hl_lines=5-6 18-19" >}}

```YAML
  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs: # Define job outputs
      script-file: ${{ steps.publish-filename.outputs.filename-output }} # Define output from step
    steps:
      - name: Get code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        working-directory: 04-react-exercise
      - name: Build website
        run: npm run build
        working-directory: 04-react-exercise
      
      - name: Publish JS filename
        id: publish-filename # Define step ID to reference output
        run: find 04-react-exercise/dist/assets/*.js -type f -execdir echo 'filename-output={}' >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT ';' # Set output value
```

### Using Job Outputs in other jobs

{{< highlight html "linenos=table,hl_lines=3 11-12" >}}

```YAML

    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v5
        with:
          name: dist-files
  
      - name: Output filename-output
        run: echo "${{needs.build.outputs.script-file}}" # Use job output
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying..."
```

## Caching dependencies

{{< lead >}}
**Dependency caching** in GitHub Actions **helps speed up workflow execution** by **storing and reusing dependencies and build outputs, reducing the need to download them each time** a workflow runs. You can set this up using the `actions/cache` action in your workflow configuration.

<b><font color=#EB4925>IMPORTANT</font></b>: 

- Caching can be used not only between Jobs but also between Workflows.
- Caching block is placed before the block that will be cached. In below example, it is `- name: Install dependencies`.
- Caching block must be used in every job to which this particular cache applies to.

See  `- name: Install dependencies` block in below example.
