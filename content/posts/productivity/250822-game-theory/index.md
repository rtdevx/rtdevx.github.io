## What is Game Theory?

**Game Theory**, branch of applied mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which <font color=#10b981>parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent</font>. 

<font color=#f43f5e>This interdependence causes each player to consider the other player‚Äôs possible decisions, or strategies, in formulating strategy</font>. A solution to a game describes the <font color=#10b981>optimal decisions of the players</font>, who may have similar, opposed, or mixed interests, and the outcomes that may result from these decisions.
