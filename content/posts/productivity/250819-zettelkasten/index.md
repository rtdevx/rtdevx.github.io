## What is the Zettelkasten method?

**Zettelkasten** is a system of identifiers to link the notes and navigating between them. This methodology leads to <font color=#10b981>higher productivity</font>.

**Zettelkasten** is not only a note taking system. It is a tool that is used for thinking since it brings a structure to note taking and "_connecting the dots_".

This method is often called a "_second brain_". And it is so for a reason...
## The history of the Zettelkasten method

The **Zettelkasten** method was created in the 20th century by social scientist _Niklas Luhman_. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which **allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles**. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.
## Writing is understanding!

Each note contains the thought or idea and should be **written in own words**. <font color=#10b981>This helps mapping the ideas in human brain</font>. Process similar to translation takes place which helps with understanding the topic.

Structuring, simplifying and linking ideas helping storing them outside of the brain and helping with solving complex problems.

A good system removes the need for remembering everything. 

> I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.
> 
> Niklas Luhmann

<font color=#10b981>Highly productive people deflect resistance</font> like judo champions. Having a flexible workflow allows doing this. This is known as "_effortless productivity_".

### Note Taking

> Clear thinking becomes clear writing. One cannot exist without the other

> William Zinnser
#### Fleeting notes

Notes being taken during content consumption are called Fleeting Notes. These are being used only as a reminder to take action later and put notes in the right order.

- **Ephemeral** - temporary, should be processed on the same or next day
- **Brief** - few words or ideas
- **Quick capture**

<font color=#f43f5e>This ability is a cornerstone of effective learning and productivity.</font>
#### Permanent notes

- Articulated
- **Written in own words**
- Solidified

- One idea per card
- **Do not copy**
- Brief and concise
- **Write to publish**
- Quotes allowed - they add context and can add value

Consistency in transferring Fleeting notes to Permanent notes should be frequent / daily. 
#### Linking notes

- Linking permanent notes is a powerful way of building knowledge
- Allows to see connection between notes
- Makes easier to recall and apply knowledge

_Don't collect information. Gather knowledge instead. Linking leads to surprises..._
## Content Consumption

- Intentionality for content consumption
- 80% of content consumed scheduled and aligned with goals
	- articles reading, YouTube videos watching are all scheduled beforehand with a clear purpose
	- each act of content consumption should align with one of the goals set
- 20% of content consumption used for relaxing
### Intentionality

- Consume the content with an intention of writing
	- increased focus
	- allows adapting more observant and analytical perspective
- Being intentional about content consumption will limit the content consumption

## Tags vs Folders

Folders are for separating, tags are for uniting

- Avoid moving files around
- Navigation benefits
- Satisfaction of collecting in folders
- Note taking system should free up time
