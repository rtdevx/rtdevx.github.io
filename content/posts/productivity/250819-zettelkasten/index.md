## What is the Zettelkasten method?

The **Zettelkasten** method is a system of managing knowledge that is highly effective and goes far beyond a note taking. It is sometimes dubbed as a "_Second Brain_".

The method is designed to create meaningful links between ideas to help categorize, remember and understand the new information.
## The history of the Zettelkasten method

The **Zettelkasten** method was created in the 20th century by social scientist _Niklas Luhman_. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which **allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles**. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.
## How to use the Zettelkasten method

Here’s how to start using the Zettelkasten method in your own life:

1. <font color=#f4e40b>Create standalone notes.</font> Each original note should contain a single idea or fact that makes sense without any supplemental knowledge.
2. <font color=#f4e40b>Use your own words.</font> Put each note in your own words so you understand its meaning when you revisit it.
3. <font color=#f4e40b>Link your notes.</font> When you create a new note, link that note to an existing note using letters and numbers. Each note should have its own “address” to prevent confusion.
4. <font color=#f4e40b>Review and repeat.</font> Regularly review and update your notes to strengthen your connections and find new insights.
