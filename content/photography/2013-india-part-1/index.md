## Where to stay in New Delhi

If you don’t have any better ideas or arrangements, head to **Paharganj** district. It is full of [backpackers]({{< ref "tags/backpacking" >}}) and is relatively safe (and close to the Train Station).

[India Mike](https://www.indiamike.com) – Travel and Community forums seem to be very good and informative source of information about travelling in India.
