My name is Rob and I am an experienced IT professional.
{{< /lead >}}

On this blog I share thoughts and learnings about technical topics such as _DevOps_, _Agile_, _Cloud_, _Windows_, _Linux_, _Ansible_, _PowerShell_. 

Iâ€™m also very interested in anything that increases my _productivity_, so you will also find writings on _Zettelkasten_, _learning techniques_ and other, more or less related subjects.
