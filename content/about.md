**Experienced IT professional** accomplished in supporting and delivering secure, resilient, and PCI-compliant infrastructure solutions across international payment ecosystems. I specialize in building and automating high-stakes platforms for credit and debit card transaction processing and fraud detection systems (3D-Secure). Resilient platforms and infrastructures trusted by global banks and financial institutions.  
  
A strong advocate of _DevOps_ and _Agile_ methodologies, I bring end-to-end transparency and _automation_ to infrastructure delivery. Skilled across _Linux_ and _Windows Server_ environments, I leverage tools like _Ansible_ and _PowerShell_ to streamline provisioning, hardening, and support of critical systems.  
  
**My toolkit includes:**

• Infrastructure automation and application provisioning (Ansible, PowerShell)  
• Multi-disciplined - Linux, Windows Server and DevOps tools and techniques  
• Agile delivery and Jira project design and automation  
• Git, GitHub, Bitbucket (version control)  
• SharePoint and Confluence (collaboration and documentation)  
• Deep experience administering Microsoft server technologies

I am currently learning: **DevOps**, **GitOps**, **Ansible**, **AWS**, **Terraform** and **Kubernetes**.
