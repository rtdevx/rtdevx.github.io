**Experienced IT professional** accomplished in supporting and delivering secure, resilient, and PCI-compliant infrastructure solutions across international payment ecosystems. I specialize in building and automating high-stakes platforms for credit and debit card transaction processing and fraud detection systems (3D-Secure). Resilient platforms and infrastructures trusted by global banks and financial institutions.  
  
A strong advocate of _DevOps_ and _Agile_ methodologies, I bring end-to-end transparency and _automation_ to infrastructure delivery. Skilled across _Linux_ and _Windows Server_ environments, I leverage tools like _Ansible_ and _PowerShell_ to streamline provisioning, hardening, and support of critical systems.

	- 140 Windows servers in total ‚Äì required high levels of coordination, collaboration and high degree of automation (I used PowerShell)
	- Highly critical fraud-detection system

- AirPlus (Lufthansa subsidiary) Prime migration
	- Shared Prime Processing infrastructure built from zero in UK datacenter, enormous learning curve and team effort
	- Multi-Institution, Multi-Currency Issuing & Acquiring solution that supports Multi Payment Schemes (including Private Label) and all Card Types (Credit, Debit, Pre-paid, Corporate, Installments)
	- I fully documented the solution during the implementation to enable datacenter teams to have wide understanding of this extremely complex architecture
	- Documentation relied upon until today by Support, Design and Delivery teams
	- Documentation enabled us to think about future automation and improvements We didn‚Äôt have those prospects before due to the complexity of this architecture and knowledge being distributed by multiple teams and team members

- CHOAR Prime migration
	- Single instance Prime Processing infrastructure built from zero in UK datacenter
	- Documentation created in the previous deployment enabled me to train India team. That allowed me to build the team and outsource all tasks to other team members.
	- Very positive credits and recognitions from India management team for conducting 2 weeks of training for the key representatives representing multiple disciplines (Windows, UNIX and Network)
	- During this project I architected new way of working using Agile methodology to help delivering this hugely demanding project where multiple teams are involved
	- This methodology is being used by whole team until today and helps multiple teams located in different geographical locations delivering complex projects
	- Platform running for a few years without a single infrastructure-related incident (to my knowledge) best proves quality of the build and training provided
