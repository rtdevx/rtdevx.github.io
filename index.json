This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.\nMore info: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state\nterraform state commands #Refer to the following subcommands for additional information:\nterraform state list #Usage: terraform state list [options] [address...]\nThe command will list all resources in the state file matching the given addresses (if any). If no addresses are given, all resources are listed.\nThe resources listed are sorted according to module depth order followed alphabetically. This means that resources that are in your immediate configuration are listed first, and resources that are more deeply nested within modules are listed last.\nMore info: terraform state list\nterraform state mv #The terraform state mv command changes bindings in Terraform state so that existing remote objects bind to new resource instances.\nUsage: terraform state mv [options] SOURCE DESTINATION\nWarning: If you are using Terraform in a collaborative environment, you must ensure that when you are using terraform state mv for a code refactoring purpose you communicate carefully with your coworkers to ensure that nobody makes any other changes between your configuration change and your terraform state mv command, because otherwise they might inadvertently create a plan that will destroy the old object and create a new object at the new address. Example: Rename a Resource\nRenaming a resource means making a configuration change like the following:\nresource \u0026#34;packet_device\u0026#34; \u0026#34;worker\u0026#34; { resource \u0026#34;packet_device\u0026#34; \u0026#34;helper\u0026#34; { # ... } To tell Terraform that it should treat the new \u0026ldquo;helper\u0026rdquo; resource as a rename of the old \u0026ldquo;worker\u0026rdquo; resource, you can pair the above configuration change with the following command:\nterraform state mv packet_device.worker packet_device.helper Example: Move a Resource Into a Module\nIf you originally wrote a resource in your root module but now wish to refactor it into a child module, you can move the resource block into the child module configuration, removing the original in the root module, and then run the following command to tell Terraform to treat it as a move:\nterraform state mv packet_device.worker module.worker.packet_device.worker More info: terraform state mv\nterraform state pull #The terraform state pull downloads and outputs state information from a remote state or local state.\nUsage: terraform state pull\nThis command downloads the state from its current location, upgrades the local copy to the latest state file version that is compatible with locally-installed Terraform, and outputs the raw format to stdout.\nMore info: terraform state pull\nterraform state replace-provider #The terraform state replace-provider command replaces the provider for resources in a Terraform state.\nUsage: terraform state replace-provider [options] FROM_PROVIDER_FQN TO_PROVIDER_FQN\nThis command will update all resources using the \u0026ldquo;from\u0026rdquo; provider, setting the provider to the specified \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; provider. This allows changing the source of a provider which currently has resources in state.\nExample: Replace Terraform provider\nThe example below replaces the hashicorp/aws provider with a fork by acme, hosted at a private registry at registry.acme.corp:\n$ terraform state replace-provider hashicorp/aws registry.acme.corp/acme/aws More info: terraform state replace-provider\nterraform state rm #The terraform state rm command removes the binding to an existing remote object without first destroying it. The remote object continues to exist but is no longer managed by Terraform.\nUsage: terraform state rm [options] ADDRESS...\nTerraform will search the state for any instances matching the given resource address, and remove the record of each one so that Terraform will no longer be tracking the corresponding remote objects.\nThis means that although the objects will still continue to exist in the remote system, a subsequent terraform plan will include an action to create a new object for each of the \u0026ldquo;forgotten\u0026rdquo; instances. Depending on the constraints imposed by the remote system, creating those objects might fail if their names or other identifiers conflict with the old objects still present.\nExample: Remove all Instances of a Resource\nThe following example will cause Terraform to \u0026ldquo;forget\u0026rdquo; all of the instances of the packet_device resource named \u0026ldquo;worker\u0026rdquo;.\n$ terraform state rm \u0026#39;packet_device.worker\u0026#39; More info: terraform state rm\nterraform state show #The terraform state show command shows the attributes of a single resource in the Terraform state.\nUsage: terraform state show [options] ADDRESS\nThe command will show the attributes of a single resource in the state file that matches the given address.\nExample: Show a Resource\nThe example below shows a packet_device resource named worker:\n$ terraform state show \u0026#39;packet_device.worker\u0026#39; # packet_device.worker: resource \u0026#34;packet_device\u0026#34; \u0026#34;worker\u0026#34; { billing_cycle = \u0026#34;hourly\u0026#34; created = \u0026#34;2015-12-17T00:06:56Z\u0026#34; facility = \u0026#34;ewr1\u0026#34; hostname = \u0026#34;prod-xyz01\u0026#34; id = \u0026#34;6015bg2b-b8c4-4925-aad2-f0671d5d3b13\u0026#34; locked = false } terraform state show works very well in combination with terraform state list:\n❯ terraform state list data.aws_availability_zones.available module.vpc.aws_db_subnet_group.database[0] module.vpc.aws_default_network_acl.this[0] module.vpc.aws_default_route_table.default[0] module.vpc.aws_default_security_group.this[0] module.vpc.aws_eip.nat[0] terraform state show \u0026#39;module.vpc.aws_eip.nat[0]\u0026#39; More info: terraform state show\nRemote State #The Terraform state subcommands all work with remote state just as if it was local state. Reads and writes may take longer than normal as each read and each write do a full network roundtrip. Otherwise, backups are still written to disk and the CLI usage is the same as if it were local state.\nBackups #All terraform state subcommands that modify the state write backup files. The path of these backup file can be controlled with -backup.\nNote that backups for state modification can not be disabled. Due to the sensitivity of the state file, Terraform forces every state modification command to write a backup file. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to remove these files manually if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to keep them around. Terraform backend #Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the resources it manages. You can either integrate with HCP Terraform to store state data or define a backend block to store state in a remote object. This lets multiple people access the state data and work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.\nTo configure a backend, add a nested backend block within the top-level terraform block. The following example configures the remote backend.\nFile: 📄providers.tf\nterraform { required_version = \u0026#34;~\u0026gt; 1.14.0\u0026#34; required_providers { aws = { source = \u0026#34;hashicorp/aws\u0026#34; version = \u0026#34;~\u0026gt; 6.0\u0026#34; } } # INFO: S3 Backend Block backend \u0026#34;s3\u0026#34; { bucket = \u0026#34;your-backend-s3-bucket\u0026#34; key = \u0026#34;terraform-core/aws-codepipelines/terraform.tfstate\u0026#34; region = \u0026#34;eu-west-2\u0026#34; dynamodb_table = \u0026#34;prod-s3backend-lock\u0026#34; encrypt = true } } More info: Terraform Backend\n\u0026raquo; Sources \u0026laquo; # terraform state Terraform state commands:\nterraform state commands reference\nterraform state list\nterraform state mv\nterraform state pull\nterraform state replace-provider\nterraform state rm\nterraform state show\nTerraform Backend:\nTerraform Backend ","date":"28 October 2025","permalink":"https://robk.uk/posts/training/terraform/terraform-on-aws-with-sre--iac-devops/terraform-state/","section":"🔰Posts","summary":"Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration\u0026hellip;","title":"Terraform State"},{"content":" The resource block defines a piece of infrastructure and specifies the settings for Terraform to create it with.\nThe arguments that an individual resource supports are determined by the provider.

They can include simple literals, complex references, and various built-in functions to manipulate data types and structures.\nMore info: Terraform Expressions\nTypes and Values #Data types that Terraform expressions can resolve to, and the literal syntaxes for values of those types.\nTypes # Strings, numbers, and bools are sometimes called primitive types. Lists/tuples and maps/objects are sometimes called complex types, structural types, or collection types. Primitive types # string - characters representing some text, like \u0026quot;hello world!\u0026quot;. number - a numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like 15 and fractional values like 6.283185. bool - a boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic. Complex types # list (or tuple) - a sequence of values, like [\u0026quot;us-west-1a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;us-west-1c\u0026quot;]. Identify elements in a list with consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero. set - a collection of unique values that do not have any secondary identifiers or ordering. Terraform does not support directly accessing elements of a set by index because sets are unordered collections. To access elements in a set by index, first convert the set to a list. Define a set. The following example specifies a set name example_set:\nvariable \u0026#34;example_set\u0026#34; { type = set(string) default = [\u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;] } Use the tolist function to convert the set to a list. The following example stores the converted list as a local variable called example_list:\nlocals { example_list = tolist(var.example_set) } You can then reference an element in the list:\noutput \u0026#34;first_element\u0026#34; { value = local.example_list[0] } output \u0026#34;second_element\u0026#34; { value = local.example_list[1] } map (or object) - a group of values identified by named labels, like {name = \u0026quot;Mabel\u0026quot;, age = 52}. Maps/objects are represented by a pair of curly braces containing a series of \u0026lt;KEY\u0026gt; = \u0026lt;VALUE\u0026gt; pairs: { name = \u0026#34;John\u0026#34; age = 52 } Key/value pairs can be separated by either a comma or a line break. The keys in a map must be strings. null - a value that represents absence or omission. null is most useful in conditional expressions, so you can dynamically omit an argument if a condition isn\u0026rsquo;t met. More info: Types and Values\nStrings and Templates #Syntaxes for string literals, including interpolation sequences and template directives.\nQuoted Strings #A quoted string is a series of characters delimited by straight double-quote characters (\u0026quot;).\n\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; Escape Sequences #In quoted strings, the backslash character serves as an escape sequence, with the following characters selecting the escape behaviour:\nSequence Replacement \\n Newline \\r Carriage Return \\t Tab \\\u0026quot; Literal quote (without terminating the string) \\\\ Literal backslash \\uNNNN Unicode character from the basic multilingual plane (NNNN is four hex digits) \\UNNNNNNNN Unicode character from supplementary planes (NNNNNNNN is eight hex digits) There are also two special escape sequences that do not use backslashes: Sequence Replacement $${ Literal ${, without beginning an interpolation sequence. %%{ Literal %{, without beginning a template directive sequence. Heredoc Strings #Terraform supports a \u0026ldquo;heredoc\u0026rdquo; style of string literal inspired by Unix shell languages, which allows multi-line strings to be expressed more clearly.\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOT hello world EOT Terraform also accepts an indented heredoc string variant that is introduced by the \u0026lt;\u0026lt;- sequence:\nblock { value = \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-EOT hello world EOT } Don\u0026rsquo;t use \u0026ldquo;heredoc\u0026rdquo; strings to generate JSON or YAML. Instead, use the jsonencode function or the yamlencode function so that Terraform can be responsible for guaranteeing valid JSON or YAML syntax.\nexample = jsonencode({ a = 1 b = \u0026#34;hello\u0026#34; }) Escape Sequences #Backslash sequences are not interpreted as escapes in a heredoc string expression. Instead, the backslash character is interpreted literally.\nHeredocs support two special escape sequences that do not use backslashes:\nSequence Replacement $${ Literal ${, without beginning an interpolation sequence. %%{ Literal %{, without beginning a template directive sequence. Interpolation #A ${ ... } sequence is an interpolation, which evaluates the expression given between the markers, converts the result to a string if necessary, and then inserts it into the final string:\n\u0026#34;Hello, ${var.name}!\u0026#34; In the above example, the named object var.name is accessed and its value inserted into the string, producing a result like \u0026ldquo;Hello, Juan!\u0026rdquo;.\nMore info: Strings and Templates\nReferences to Values #How to refer to named values like variables and resource attributes.\nThe main kinds of named values available in Terraform are:\nResources Input variables Local values Child module outputs Data sources Filesystem and workspace info Block-local values More info: References to Values\nOperators #Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.\nWhen multiple operators are used together in an expression, they are evaluated in the following order of operations:\n!, - (multiplication by -1) *, /, % +, - (subtraction) \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;= ==, != \u0026amp;\u0026amp; || Arithmetic Operators Equality Operators Comparison Operators Logical Operators More info: Operators\nFunction Calls #Syntax for calling Terraform\u0026rsquo;s built-in functions.\nThe Terraform language has a number of built-in functions that can be used in expressions to transform and combine values.

A splat expression can also be used to access attributes and indexes from lists of complex types by extending the sequence of operations to the right of the symbol:\nvar.list[*].interfaces[0].name More info: Splat Expressions\nDynamic Blocks #A way to create multiple repeatable nested blocks within a resource or other construct.\nWithin top-level block constructs like resources, expressions can usually be used only when assigning a value to an argument using the name = expression form. This covers many uses, but some resource types include repeatable nested blocks in their arguments, which typically represent separate objects that are related to (or embedded within) the containing object:\nresource \u0026#34;aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment\u0026#34; \u0026#34;tfenvtest\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;tf-test-name\u0026#34; # can use expressions here setting { # but the \u0026#34;setting\u0026#34; block is always a literal block } } You can dynamically construct repeatable nested blocks like setting using a special dynamic block type, which is supported inside resource, data, provider, and provisioner blocks:\nresource \u0026#34;aws_elastic_beanstalk_environment\u0026#34; \u0026#34;tfenvtest\u0026#34; { name = \u0026#34;tf-test-name\u0026#34; application = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.tftest.name solution_stack_name = \u0026#34;64bit Amazon Linux 2018.03 v2.11.4 running Go 1.12.6\u0026#34; dynamic \u0026#34;setting\u0026#34; { for_each = var.settings content { namespace = setting.value[\u0026#34;namespace\u0026#34;] name = setting.value[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] value = setting.value[\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;] } } } A dynamic block acts much like a for expression, but produces nested blocks instead of a complex typed value. It iterates over a given complex value, and generates a nested block for each element of that complex value.\nOveruse of dynamic blocks can make configuration hard to read and maintain, so we recommend using them only when you need to hide details in order to build a clean user interface for a re-usable module.\nAlways write nested blocks out literally where possible.\nMore info: Dynamic Blocks\nValidate your configuration #To verify variable conditions, check blocks, and resource preconditions and postconditions.\nValidate your configuration to improve your module consumer\u0026rsquo;s troubleshooting, make your runs more predictable, and help your maintainers understand your configuration\u0026rsquo;s intent. Input variable validation #Use input variable validation to perform the following tasks:\nVerify input variables meet specific format requirements. Verify input values fall within acceptable ranges. Prevent Terraform operations if a variable is misconfigured. For example, you can validate whether a variable value has valid AMI ID syntax.\nvariable \u0026#34;image_id\u0026#34; { type = string description = \u0026#34;The id of the machine image (AMI) to use for the server.\u0026#34; validation { condition = length(var.image_id) \u0026gt; 4 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; substr(var.image_id, 0, 4) == \u0026#34;ami-\u0026#34; error_message = \u0026#34;The image_id value must be a valid AMI id, starting with \\\u0026#34;ami-\\\u0026#34;.\u0026#34; } } If you set the value of the image_id variable to a string without AMI ID syntax, the condition evaluates to false. When a variable validation fails, Terraform errors, displays the configured error_message, and stops the operation from proceeding.\nMore info: Validate your configuration\nType Constraints #Syntax for referring to a type, rather than a value of that type. Input variables expect this syntax in their type argument.\nMore info: Type Constraints\nVersion Constraints #Syntax of special strings that define a set of allowed software versions. Terraform uses version constraints in several places.\nUse the following syntax to specify version constraints:\nversion = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;\u0026#34; In the following example, Terraform installs a versions 1.2.0 and newer, as well as version older than 2.0.0:\nversion = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 1.2.0, \u0026lt; 2.0.0\u0026#34; The following table describes the operators you can use to configure version constraints:\nOperator Description =, no operator Allows only one exact version number. Cannot be combined with other conditions. != Excludes an exact version number. \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;= Compares to a specified version. Terraform allows versions that resolve to true. The \u0026gt; and \u0026gt;= operators request newer versions. The \u0026lt; and \u0026lt;= operators request older versions. ~\u0026gt; Allows only the right-most version component to increment. Examples:\n- ~\u0026gt; 1.0.4: Allows Terraform to install 1.0.5 and 1.0.10 but not 1.1.0.\n- ~\u0026gt; 1.1: Allows Terraform to install 1.2 and 1.10 but not 2.0.

This improves usability and reduces boilerplate. To Support Multiple Environments\nDefaults can help standardize behavior across environments (e.g., default tags, naming conventions). To Avoid Breaking Changes\nWhen updating a module, adding a new variable without a default will break existing usage unless users update their code. Providing a default ensures backward compatibility. When Not to Provide Defaults # If the variable is critical and must be explicitly set (e.g., bucket_name), omit the default to force the user to provide it. If the value depends on external context (e.g., environment-specific settings), it\u0026rsquo;s better to require it. Best Practice # Use defaults for convenience and safety. Avoid defaults for values that must be unique or environment-specific. Always document your variables with description to clarify intent.

Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run terraform init in the future. terraform init -upgrade - command to upgrade the provider in Terraform. This command will initialize the working directory and upgrade the provider to the latest version available, including any additional functionality that may have been added. If Terraform was already initiated and providers were downloaded, Terraform will not upgrade to the new version by default. terraform validate validates syntax and consistency of the terraform files terraform plan creates an execution plan terraform performs a refresh and determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files terraform apply will apply the changes required to be in line with the desired state by default, apply will scan the current directory and apply it\u0026rsquo;s configuration (provision the infrastructure) terraform apply -refresh-only - detect drift between the Terraform configuration and the actual state of the resources in the cloud provider. It will update the state file with any changes made outside of Terraform, ensuring that the configuration remains in sync with the actual resources. terraform apply -replace=\u0026lt;resource\u0026gt; - allows you to tag the specific resource for replacement without impacting the rest of the managed infrastructure. This ensures that only the tagged resource is recreated, potentially resolving any issues with the local script execution. terraform destroy will destroy the terraform-managed infrastructure terraform destroy -target \u0026lt;virtual machine\u0026gt; - destroy only the target resource. Other useful commands # terraform fmt - HashiCorp recommends using consistent formatting in all config files by using the terraform fmt command. Optional command, helps with formatting terraform state command can be used to check what resources have been deployed against the terraform state file list - list resources in the state show - show a resource in the state terraform state rm - will remove the specified resource from the Terraform state, allowing you to then run terraform destroy to remove all remaining resources except for the resource that was removed from the state. This approach effectively excludes the specified resource from the destruction process. The terraform state command and its subcommands can be used for various tasks related to the Terraform state. Some of the tasks that can be performed using the terraform state command are:\nInspecting the Terraform state: The terraform state show subcommand can be used to display the current state of a Terraform configuration. This can be useful for verifying the current state of resources managed by Terraform.\nUpdating the Terraform state: The terraform state mv and terraform state rm subcommands can be used to move and remove resources from the Terraform state, respectively.\nExample: terraform state mv aws_s3_bucket.data-bucket aws_s3_bucket.data-bucket-prod\nPulling and pushing the Terraform state: The terraform state pull and terraform state push subcommands can be used to retrieve and upload the Terraform state from and to a remote backend, respectively. This is useful when multiple users or systems are working with the same Terraform configuration.\nImporting resources into Terraform: The terraform state import subcommand can be used to import existing resources into the Terraform state. This allows Terraform to manage resources that were created outside of Terraform.\nBy using the terraform state command and its subcommands, users can manage and manipulate the Terraform state in various ways, helping to ensure that their Terraform configurations are in the desired state.\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/list\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state\nMore info: Terraform State\nterraform workspace delete - Delete a workspace list - List Workspaces new - Create a new workspace select - Select a workspace show - Show the name of the current workspace Terraform workspaces are a feature that allow you to manage multiple instances of your infrastructure using the same configuration files, each with its own isolated state file. This helps in organizing different environments, such as development and production, without interfering with each other. terraform show - Display the current state of the resources being managed by Terraform. It provides detailed information about the infrastructure that Terraform is managing, including resource attributes, dependencies, and configuration. terraform output - Reads an output variable from a Terraform state file and prints the value. terraform refresh - Update the state file of your infrastructure with metadata that matches the physical resources they are tracking The difference between terraform refresh and terraform apply -refresh-only:\nterraform refresh updates the state file to match real infrastructure but does not produce or apply a plan, while terraform apply -refresh-only runs through the full plan/apply workflow but only refreshes the state (no resource changes), making it auditable and consistent with Terraform’s apply process.\nterraform refresh is being considered a legacy command. Newer workflows encourage apply -refresh-only.\nterraform providers- Prints out a tree of modules in the referenced configuration annotated with their provider requirements It is said that best terraform practice is to output the terraform plan to a file and then run terraform apply with the file input.\nterraform plan -out tf.plan terraform apply tf.plan *terraform will not ask for confirmation (just like using it with the -auto-approve option) when executing the plan from the file.\nThe terraform state file is the only way Terraform can track which resources it is managing. It often contains sensitive information so must be stored securely and access must be restricted.\nterraform graph - used to generate a visual representation of either a configuration or execution plan.

A module consists of a collection of .tf files kept together in a directory. Modules are the main way of packaging and reusing resource configurations in Terraform Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as it\u0026rsquo;s root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files placed in the main working directory A Terraform module (usually the root module of a configuration) can call other modules to include their resources into the configuration A module that has been called by another module is often referred to as a child module Child modules can be called multiple times within the same configuration and multiple configurations can use the same child module In addition to modules from the local system, Terraform can load modules from a public or private registry It is therefore possible to publish modules for others to use and to use modules published by others Version Constraints #Source:\nVersion Constraints Version Constraints Best Practices Use the following syntax to specify version constraints:\nversion = \u0026#34;\u0026lt;operator\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;\u0026#34; In the following example, Terraform installs a versions 1.2.0 and newer, as well as version older than 2.0.0:\nversion = \u0026#34;\u0026gt;= 1.2.0, \u0026lt; 2.0.0\u0026#34; Operators #The following table describes the operators you can use to configure version constraints:\nOperator Description =, no operator Allows only one exact version number. Cannot be combined with other conditions. != Excludes an exact version number. \u0026gt;, \u0026gt;=, \u0026lt;, \u0026lt;= Compares to a specified version. Terraform allows versions that resolve to true. The \u0026gt; and \u0026gt;= operators request newer versions. The \u0026lt; and \u0026lt;= operators request older versions. ~\u0026gt; Allows only the right-most version component to increment. Examples:\n- ~\u0026gt; 1.0.4: Allows Terraform to install 1.0.5 and 1.0.10 but not 1.1.0.\n- ~\u0026gt; 1.1: Allows Terraform to install 1.2 and 1.10 but not 2.0. It is a Best Practice to use an exact version when using modules from the Terraform registry since they can change significantly between versions and cause issues. \u0026raquo; Sources \u0026laquo; #Kalyan\u0026rsquo;s GitHub Repositories:\nhttps://github.com/stacksimplify/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate/tree/main/02-Terraform-Basics https://github.com/stacksimplify/terraform-on-aws-ec2/tree/main/02-Terraform-Basics Additional resources:\nAdditional Reference\nResource: AWS Instance\nResource: AWS Instance Argument Reference\nResource: AWS Instance Attribute Reference\nResource: Meta-Arguments\naws_instance resource documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/-/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance\nVersion Constraints\nVersion Constraints Best Practices\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/state/list\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/state\nhttps://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/graph\n\u0026raquo; References \u0026laquo; # Terraform registry \u0026raquo; Disclaimer \u0026laquo; #\rThis series draws heavily from Kalyan Reddy Daida\u0026rsquo;s Terraform on AWS with SRE \u0026 IaC DevOps course on Udemy.\nHis content was a game-changer in helping me understand Terraform.\nAbout the instructor\r🌐 Website\r📺 YouTube\r💼 LinkedIn\r🗃️ GitHub\rℹ️Shared for educational purposes only, no rights reserved.\n","date":"2 October 2025","permalink":"https://robk.uk/posts/training/terraform/terraform-on-aws-with-sre--iac-devops/02-terraform-basics/","section":"🔰Posts","summary":"Terraform Basics.

Communication process entails both directions (encapsulation and decapsulation).\nLayers 5,6 and 7 can be grouped together. They are all responsible to produce the data (Protocol Data Unit - PDU) for the Transport layer.\n7. Application Layer #Applications produce the data for the Transport layer and often provide a user interface to interact with.\nExample protocols used in the Application layer: HTTP(S), SMTP, FTP,DNS, SSH\u0026hellip;\nThe application layer is concerned with the specific type of application.\n6. Presentation Layer #The presentation layer is primarily responsible for syntax of the data for the applications to send and consume (e.g. HTML, CSV, JSON).\nEncryption / Decryption Compression 5. Session Layer #Session Layer is responsible for establishing, managing, terminating sessions between two devices.\nNetwork File System (NFS) or Server Message Block (SMB) are commonly used protocols at the session layer.\nOSI and TCP IP Models - Best Explanation\n4. Transport Layer #The primary role of the Transport Layer is to ensure that data packets arrive in the right order.\nTCP - data must be intact (e.g. file sharing) acknowledgment (ACK) of the successful data transmission and re-transmission of the data in error slower than UDP but more reliable UDP - retaining packets is less critical (e.g. video streaming) faster than TCP but less reliable (no ACK) The data in the transport layer is referred to as segments. In this layer source and destination port is added in the header. Segmentation is essential for multiplexing.\n3. Network Layer #The Network Layer is responsible for the transmission of data (in this layer referred to as packets) from one host to another that is located in different networks.\nNetwork Layer also takes care of routing - finding the shortest path to transmit the packet, from a number of routes available.\nNetwork Layer is utilizing IP protocol in order to route. Network devices (routers and switches) are appending the source and destination IP address to the packet\u0026rsquo;s header.\n2. Data Link Layer #The Data Link Layer refers to technologies used to connect two machines across a network.\nData in this layer is referred to as frame.\nEthernet is an example of a standard at this layer. Switches and Bridges are common Data Link Layer devices. The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:\nLogical Link Control (LLC) Media Access Control (MAC) 1. Physical Layer #The Physical Layer refers to the physical communication medium and technologies to transmit data across that medium.\nThe physical layer contains information in the form of bits. Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting individual bits from one node to the next.\nWhen receiving data, this layer will get the signal received and convert it into 0s and 1s and send them to the Data Link layer, which will put the frame back together. Common physical layer devices are Hub, Repeater, Modem, and Cables.\nMore: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/\n\u0026raquo; Sources \u0026laquo; #What is OSI Model:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/ https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/osi-model/ \u0026raquo; Disclaimer \u0026laquo; # Disclaimer: Content for educational purposes only, no rights reserved.

Operational Excellence #Operational excellence includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures. #Design Principles:\nPerform Operations as Code - IaS Frequent, small, reversible changes - reverse in case of failure Refine operations procedures frequently - ensure team members are familiar with it Anticipate failure Learn from the failures Use managed services - to reduce operational burden Implement observability for actionable insights - performance, reliability, cost, \u0026hellip; 2. Security #Security includes an ability to protect information, systems and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. #Design Principles:\nImplement a strong identity foundation - centralize privilege management and reduce (or eliminate) reliance on long-term credentials - Principle of least privilege - IAM Enable traceability - integrate logs and metrics with systems to automatically respond and take action - Cloud Monitoring Apply security at all layers - edge network, VPC, subnet, load balancer, (every) EC2 instance, operating system, application Automate security best practices Protect data in transit and at rest - encryption, tokenization and access control Keep people away from data - reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data Prepare for security events - run incident response simulations and use tools with automation to increase your speed of detection, investigation and recovery 3. Reliability #Reliability is an ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues. #Design Principles:\nTest recovery procedures - use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before Automatically recover from failure - anticipate and remediate failures before they occur Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability - distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don\u0026rsquo;t share a common point of failure Stop guessing capacity - maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning Manage change in automation - use automation to make changes to infrastructure 4. Performance Efficiency #Performance Efficiency includes ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. #Design Principles:\nDemocratize advanced technologies - advance technologies become services and hence you can focus more on product development Go Global in minutes - easy deployment in multiple regions Use serverless architecture - avoid the burden of managing servers Experiment more often - easy to carry out comparative testing Mechanical sympathy - be aware of all AWS services 5. Cost Optimization #Cost Optimization includes ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. #Design Principles:\nAdopt a consumption mode - pay only for what you use Measure overall efficiency - use CloudWatch Stop spending money on data center operations - AWS does the infrastructure part and enables customer to focus on organization projects Analyze and attribute expenditure - accurate identification of system usage and costs helps to measure Return on Investment (ROI) - make sure to use tags! Use managed and application level services to reduce cost of ownership - as managed services operate at cloud scale then can offer a lower cost per transaction or service 6. Sustainability #Sustainability focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of running cloud workloads. #Design Principles:\nUnderstand your impact - establish performance indicators, evaluate improvements Establish sustainability goals - set long-term goals for each workload, model Return on Investment (ROI) Maximize utilization = right size each workload to maximize the energy efficiency of the underlying hardware and minimize idle resources Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings - and design for flexibility to adopt new technologies over time Use managed services - shared services reduce the amount of infrastructure AWS Well-Architected Tool #Free tool to review your architecture against the 6 pillars of Well-Architected Framework and adopt architectural best practices.\nAWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool #Tool to track, measure, review and forecast the carbon emissions generated from your AWS usage.\nAWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) #Helps you build and then execute a comprehensive plan for your digital transformation through innovative use of AWS.\nCreated by AWS Professionals by taking advantage of AWS Best Practices and lessons learned from 1000s of customers.\nAWS CAF groups it\u0026rsquo;s capabilities in six perspectives: # Business\nBusiness perspective helps to ensure that your cloud investments accelerate your digital transformation ambitions and business outcomes People\nServes a bridge between technology and business, accelerating the cloud journey to help organizations more rapidly evolve to a culture of continuous growth, learning and where change becomes BAU Governance\nHelps orchestrating cloud initiatives while maximizing organizational benefits and minimizing transformation related risks Platform\nHelps building an enterprise-grade, scalable, hybrid cloud platform and modernize existing workloads Security\nHelps achieving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data and cloud workflows Operations\nHelps ensuring that your cloud services are delivered at a level that meets the needs of your business AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)\nAWS CAF - Transformation Domains # Technology - using the cloud to migrate and modernize legacy infrastructure, applications, data and analytics platforms Process - digitizing, automating and optimizing your business operations Organization - reimagining your operating model AWS CAF - Transformation Phases # Envision - demonstrate how the Cloud will accelerate business outcomes Align - identify capability gaps across the 6 AWS CAF Perspectives which results in an Action Plan Launch - build and deliver pilot initiatives in production and demonstrate incremental business value Scale - expand pilot initiatives to the desired scale while realizing the desired business benefits More: AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)\nAWS Right Sizing #EC2 has many instance types.

This methodology leads to higher productivity.\nZettelkasten is not only a note taking system. It is a tool that is used for thinking since it brings a structure to note taking and \u0026ldquo;connecting the dots\u0026rdquo;.\nThis method is often called a \u0026ldquo;second brain\u0026rdquo;. And it is so for a reason\u0026hellip;\nThe history of the Zettelkasten method #The Zettelkasten method was created in the 20th century by social scientist Niklas Luhman. He used this system to organize his thoughts and research, which allowed him to publish more than 50 books and hundreds of articles. Luhman used physical slip boxes for his Zettelkasten, adding notes and sub notes into the box as he created new ideas.\nWriting is understanding! #Each note contains the thought or idea and should be written in own words. This helps mapping the ideas in human brain. Process similar to translation takes place which helps with understanding the topic.\nStructuring, simplifying and linking ideas helping storing them outside of the brain and helping with solving complex problems.\nA good system removes the need for remembering everything.\nI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.\nNiklas Luhmann\nHighly productive people deflect resistance like judo champions. Having a flexible workflow allows doing this.
